3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - **Branch to deploy**: `main`
   - **Build command**: (leave empty)
   - **Publish directory**: `.` (root directory)
   - Click "Deploy site"

4. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Go to Site settings ‚Üí Domain management
   - Add custom domain if desired
   - Otherwise use the provided `.netlify.app` domain

### Method 2: Manual Deploy

1. **Prepare Files**

   - Exclude `.git` folder and other unnecessary files

2. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Drag and drop your zip file to the deploy area
   - Wait for deployment to complete

## ‚úÖ Verification

After deployment, verify these features work:

### **Core Functionality**
- [ ] Solar system loads and animates
- [ ] All planets are visible and orbiting
- [ ] Halley's Comet appears with tails
- [ ] Mouse controls work (rotate, zoom, pan)

### **Interactive Features**
- [ ] Planet selection from menu works
- [ ] Direct clicking on planets works
- [ ] Zoom functionality works in both modes
- [ ] Speed controls adjust animation
- [ ] Escape key returns to overview

### **Chatbot**
- [ ] Chatbot opens and responds
- [ ] Planet-specific questions work
- [ ] Halley's Comet questions work
- [ ] Chat features (print, copy, clear) work

### **Visual Elements**
- [ ] All textures load properly
- [ ] Sun corona effect visible
- [ ] Saturn's rings appear
- [ ] Comet tails are visible
- [ ] Lighting and shadows work

## üîß Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Textures not loading**
   - Check that all files in `/assets/textures/` are uploaded
   - Verify file paths are correct (case-sensitive)

2. **Three.js not loading**
   - Ensure `/js/three.min.js` and `/js/OrbitControls.js` are present
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **CORS errors in local development**
   - Use a local server (Python, Node.js, etc.)
   - Don't open HTML file directly in browser

4. **Performance issues**
   - Check browser compatibility (WebGL support)
   - Try reducing animation speed
   - Close other browser tabs

### **Browser Compatibility**
- **Recommended**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **Requires**: WebGL support
- **Mobile**: Works on modern mobile browsers

## üìä Performance Optimization

### **For Better Performance**
- Textures are already optimized for web
- Consider reducing texture sizes for slower connections
- Animation speed can be adjusted by users

### **Monitoring**
- Use Netlify Analytics to track usage
- Monitor Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
- Check browser console for any errors

## üîÑ Updates and Maintenance

### **Making Updates**
```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub.

### **Version Control**
- Use semantic versioning (1.0.0, 1.1.0, etc.)
- Tag releases for major updates
- Keep changelog updated

## üìà Analytics and SEO

### **Add Analytics (Optional)**
- Google Analytics
- Netlify Analytics
- Plausible Analytics

### **SEO Optimization**
- Meta tags are already included
- Add structured data if needed
- Submit sitemap to search engines

## üéâ Success!

Your Interactive Solar System should now be live and accessible to the world!

**Next Steps:**
- Share your creation on social media
- Submit to educational resource directories
- Consider adding more features based on user feedback
